          <div class="blog-txt1 pt-1 pb-2">Nursery, Psychology</div>
          <div class="blog-txt1 pt-2 pb-2">Today was all about being a part of madras week and getting to know why , when , how and other whereabouts and what abouts of madras , thanks to mrs. Debjani bahaduri mam for her wonderful child friendly story session about history of Madras right on the walls of fort, and the most famous landmark - Marina. But you all know what , while we explored a lot about the history , we also got to see an isthmus( landform near Coovum river) , understood why we should never litter, read big numbers and names on every sign board while walking ðŸ™‚ we wish every child in the world a very happy learning now and forever</div>

          <div class="blog-txt1 pt-2 pb-2">Elementary â€” what do we say about it in a word ðŸ™‚ age of grandeur, they are always up to something that we can never expect .. so for us it was not just an independence day, it was a day were they wanted to show to the world that they are proud to be Indians .., they read in a book that when a person achieves something for the first time or something which no one else has achieved , itâ€™s a proud moment for their country , and that they hoist national flag there, and there it all got started, they climbed up a nearest hill which they never have trekked before and sang national anthem</div>

          <div class="blog-txt1 pt-2 pb-2">Inspired by a workshop that we teachers attended , we extended the same to our parents , to help them understand how children read and write in a Montessori elementary classroom where there is no rote writing nor there is any prescribed text books , so it all started very beautifully the discussions started on choosing the work , how to organise , data collection , time management, acceptance , tolerance , self learning , build confidence and their team work helped them to keep going till the end ( Final presentation) .</div>
